# BankofValdostaCorp
The Bank of Valdosta Corp. is another java application I made in computer science. 
I did have a little fun with this one because it's the first time I've made something essential to everyone's life.
I want to be able to put the things I learned creating this into making something like a calculator app that will transform into a vault.
For things you don't want people to see for your own privacy. 
For example,photos passwords or just personal notes, but you will need to type in a certain equation on the calculator to get in it ;) â€‹
